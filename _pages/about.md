I am a PhD student in Physics at Cotton University.
I study how artificial intelligence can be applied to advance our understanding of the physical world.
Physics simulation now stands alongside theory and experiment as a cornerstone of scientific inquiry.
My works aim to study how we can develop a unified framework for AI and physics that leverages the strengths of both disciplines.
