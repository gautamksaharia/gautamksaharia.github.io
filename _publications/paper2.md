Our findings reveal that these reversible coordinate transformations are monotonic for odd-order hierarchies but not strictly monotonic for even-order hierarchies or combinations of both. Nevertheless, the Jacobian of the transformation remains unity across all cases. We have identified a set of constraints among the dispersion and nonlinear coefficients of the general nonautonomous NLSE hierarchy that are preserved under these transformations. We hope our analysis provides a universal mathematical framework for studying diverse physical systems in fields such as nonlinear optics, plasma physics, atomic physics, and climate physics.
