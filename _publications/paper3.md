A key innovation is the use of an auxiliary function to simplify the bilinearization process. This approach yields both dark and bright soliton solutions, with detailed analysis of their properties and interactions. The method is extensible to other nonlinear equations.
Additionally, the study establishes a connection between the FLE and the Landau-Lifshitz spin system through a gauge transformation, opening up new avenues for research.
