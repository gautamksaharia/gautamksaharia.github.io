We investigate the nonautonomous higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and its reversible transformations. We propose a generalized reversible transformation between the forced higher-order NLSE with both focusing and defocusing nonlinearity and the free higher-order NLSE. In doing so, we have identified a set of new constraints among the higher-order dispersion and nonlinear coefficients that are preserved under these transformations. This leads us to discover new higher-order inhomogeneous equations. Using the transformation, we directly obtain dark and bright solitons of the forced higher-order NLSE. These reversible transformations enable us to link NLSE and higher-order NLSE (HNLSE) from the nonisospectral family of inverse scattering problems to the class of isospectral NLSEs, allowing for their study within a unified mathematical framework. We hope that our analysis provides a robust mathematical platform for exploring inhomogeneous NLS equations and opens up new possibilities for applications in physics.
