We are looking at a equation called the nonautonomous higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which is used to describe light waves in optical fibers. In our research, we've created a method to switch between two versions of these equations: one that has extra forces acting on it (forced) and one that doesn’t (free). This method works for equations that make waves either focusing) or defocusing.  This helped us discover new types of equations with more complex behaviors. We also used our method to find special wave shapes called dark and bright solitons. These are waves that can travel long distances without changing their shape. Our method allows us to link a group of NLSEs that usually change over time (nonisospectral) to those that don’t (isospectral). This makes it easier to study them using the same mathematical tools. We hope our work will help people understand these complex equations better and lead to new uses in physics.
