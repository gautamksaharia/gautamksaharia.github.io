By incorporating conserved densities into the loss function, the modified PINN demonstrates improved accuracy in generating data-driven solutions for bright, dark, and two-soliton interactions compared to traditional PINN methods. The use of multiple conserved densities further enhances the model's performance.

This research contributes to the application of deep learning in nonlinear physics, specifically in the field of nonlinear optics.
