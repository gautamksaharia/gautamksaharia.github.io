We introduce an auxiliary function to simplify the bilinearization process, leading to the derivation of bright one- and two-soliton solutions, as well as a general framework for N-soliton solutions. These solitons exhibit tunable positions and elastic interactions.

Furthermore, the study establishes a generalized Lax pair and derives conserved quantities for the equation. The findings are expected to have implications in nonlinear optics and other relevant fields.

Overall, the research provides a new approach to analyzing the gauged Fokas-Lenells equation and its soliton solutions.
